Some projects contain dummy PFX files. These PFX files are NOT
the ones with which the TC .NET Interface distributions are signed, those
are kept secret.

In order to unlock the private keys of the dummy PFX files,
use:

    "123123"  (without the quotes)


Official TC .NET Interface distributions are signed with private keys.
